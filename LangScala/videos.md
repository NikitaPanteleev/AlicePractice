#David Christiansen - Coding for Types: The Universe Patern in Idris - Curry On

It university of Copenhagen.

Red - constructor,
Blue - type constructor
Green - defined constant
Purple - bound variable

##The universe pattern

- Represent types with codes

`data Column = Text | Real | Integer`

- Interpret the codes as types

```
interpCol: Column -> Type
interpCol: Text -> String
interpÐ¡ol: Real -> Double
interpCol: Integer -> Integer
```

### Sql example

codehale limitation - not cheap in memory/cpu (??? proofs)
They use: https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram
- fixed memory cost
- constant time for recording
- blazingly fast (3-6 ns for recording).

TraceContext to measure execution between threads. Even tracing among
applications.

Jacob nielson:
What is fast
0.1s is fast - i am manipulating process
1s this is not me this is some processing
10s - not me 

KissMetrics:
47% of users want 2 seconds or less
40% of users will leave after waiting for more than 3 seconds
6 or 4 seconds for search.

Requirements:
- 95% less than 400ms
- 99% less than 1.2
- 100$ less than 4ms

lattency 25$, 50%, 95$ - we don't know about rest 5%

http://latencytipoftheday.blogspot.ae/
42 requests per page, 5 click.
- 0.003% of users will not experience 95%
- 18% of users will experience 95% only once.

chance experiencing 99

*SHOW MAXIMUM VALUE*

So why not record 99999?
- dont need that level of perfection
- have not enough data.

While load testing.
- 1 request per second. but what if response takes more than 1
  second. Coordinated omission

During measurement
- slow operations measured only once (but maybe there was long
reindexing inside)
- slow operation could be outside

Service time vs Response time.
if you push above limit, your requests are in queue and you have to
wait and response time linearly increases.

Dont test above limit - it's like choosing bumper to sport car to
avoid crash. The limit itself matters. Find how fast is safe. WE dont
need insane rates
