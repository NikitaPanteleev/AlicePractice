## Flows in Networks.
*Network* -  a directed graph.
- Each edge is assigned a positive real capacity G(e)
- One or more vertex is labelled as a flow
- One or more vertex is labelled as a sink

*FLOW*
- Flow for each edge 0 <= f(e) <= G(e)
- Conservation of flow: sum incoming = sum of outcoming for all vertices except for flow and sink

*Size of Flow*
- outcoming from source - incoming into source = outcoming from sink - incoming to sink

*Maxflow*
