Traditional approach is waterfall process with little uncertainty or agile.

Lean startup:

## 1.2 MVP: Minimum Viable Product
Minimal - core features.
Viable - will people use it & user pay for it
Product

Timing (few years), prepared, mentors
## 1.6 The Art of the Pitch
High concept pitch 
Elevator Pitch (5 words)

## The Role of early hires.
Thiel’s law: A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. 
Early hires matter: 
– People you work with every day 
– Performance differences are huge 
– Role inertia 
middle managers get 22%, innovators gets 7%
Hire slow, fire fast.
good enougth isn't 

## Goals & motivation.
3 founders is good.
similar background are faster but less innovation and invention than different background.
kings vs rich.

## Founders agreement
Unknown unknowns.
Vesting agreements, contingent provision (the first who gets investment), 
equal dividng is not good idea

## Hire key managment
Hire sales & team leader are the hardest.
Sales:
- somenone from founding team made few sales
- not a VP before
- after 5 lost sales can mae pivot
Tech:
- referrals
-  attract talent.
= top hires attract other tops
- programming

## Finding technical resources
Outsource vs in-house.
venturePact, rentACoder, elance, Upwork, freelancer.com

## 2.6 Allocating equity amount members.
Cap table like:
founders = 50%
key team members = 10%
option pool = 10%
outside investors = 30%
pre-moeny valuation

Assets:
- original idea
- sweat
- cash

Stocks should be taxed, that's why they are are issued as stock options.
Advisors - brand, services.

# Week 3: Networks, Professional Services, and Intellectual Property
## 3.0 Networks, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship
Diversity Brokerage Trust 
Effective networks shape the flow of ideas, personnel, funding, endorsements 
Effective teams: cohesive internally, brokers externally
Examine your individual network and your team’s network and build contacts strategically 
## ADVISORY BOARD AND MENTORS
Determine your business’s greatest area of need
Set the expectations of what you’ll need from board members. 
Devise what you will offer board members in return. 
IN SHORT:
Advisors help establish credibility 
Recruit advisors for short-term objectives 
Set term limits – Advisory roles should have limits: 12 months or 24 months 
Look for advisors in unusual places 
There is no standard compensation scheme for advisors 
Don't treat advisors like employees or suppliers

## PROFESSIONAL SERVICES: LAWYERS & ACCOUNTANTS
Hiring lawyers and accountants 
Better to do it early 
You can often work with them on price 
Experience matters

How to do it:
Ask your other advisors 
Talk to more than one firm 
Make sure you are comfortable, don’t feel talked down to 
Make sure they are not learning on your money
## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Patents, copyrights, trade secrecy (nda)

# Branding, Authenticity, Strategy
##Dot-Com Availability 
• In most cases you should have full dot-com availability. 
• Ideally, no hyphens or special characters. 
• Preferably not .net, .org, or other top-level domains. 
• Even country domains (e.g., name.cn or name.in) not so important as .com

##Naming Criteria 
• You may legally and practically use the name (e.g., dot-com domain available, trademark) 
• Evokes the thing you are naming 
• Positive associations 
• Easy to say 
• Unambiguous spelling 
• Memorable 
• Not too long 
•  (All in the context of target global markets.)

## Naming generation:
Chunks:
Dictionary words(soft, next), proper nouns and derivative (Swiss), other roots (latin or greek), affixes (pro, neo, city, max, tech, star)
Manipulate words
Simple, compund, synthetic, name analysis by criteria (length,associations,spelling, tone, easy to say)
Survey
Rate brand + 2 question (which you remember). Order of answer is random.

## Authenticity and personality

Empathy, focus on customer, imputation (customer immediately understand the product).
Functional, emotional & symbolic
Personality (sincere, competent, sophisticated,exciting, rugged).

##BIAS AND MERITOCRACY IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Time, advice, and money are not doled out equally 
What’s Your Unfair Advantage?
Large extent about homophily, similarity, and iden@fying 
Don’t tell people what is so great about you, your product, your service 
Tell them stories, and they'll figure out how the stories apply 

In short:
If you want advice, ask for money… 
If you want money, ask for advice
Always pivot to find the better way to overcome bias.

Accelerator 
Intense Program (usually ~3 months) 
Large mentor‐driven network

Pitch / Demo day with potential investors
## ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGY
Value chain: working with others (cooperating) in a value chain to bring a product or service to market 
Disruptive: working to undermine the industry’s existing value chain, usually via a competition strategy (see work by Christensen) 
Blue ocean: creating new market spaces (see work by Kim & Mauborgne)
Among unicorns 80% value chain, 15% disruptive and only 5% blue ocean.

Why doesn’t cooperation always occur? 
Transaction costs 
One party (often the would-be partner) is not interested 
Startup disclosure dilemma – Negotiating terms of exchange (including price) may undermine startup value 
Disruption always, when emerges, has less efficiency than current solutions.

Entrepreneurial switchback strategies 
Temporary competition switchback (enter as competitor switch to cooperative) 
Temporary cooperation switchback
