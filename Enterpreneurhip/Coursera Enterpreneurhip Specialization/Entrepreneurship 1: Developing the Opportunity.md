# Opportunity analysis
Certainty, uncertainty & risk.
Methodologies::
 - Business canvas
 - lean startup (build, measure, learn).
 - discovery driven growth

Where does advantage come?
Monopoly or illegal
Cost advantage from scale
Something valuable, better and different

Innovation = new match between solution and need.
need must be real.
Solution has to meet the need
price - costs > 0

Pull (start from problem + 10+ solutions)
Push (start with solution + find needs) but take into account competitors pull approach.
## Customers  as sources of opportunities
Dell’s idea storm & myStarbucks idea.
Crowd sourcing platforms as a proxy for demand but
Voting is not purchasing
Voting population isn’t representation of typical customers.

Reasons to participate in crowd sourcing.
Indirect feedback.
## Video: 2.4 Importance of the Idea (VIDE Model)
Three main factors:
The team, the team, the team
Value = f (idea, development, exogenous factors).
## 2.5 Assessing Opportunities
How significant is the need?
How effective solution
Large gross margin?
How hard will it be to acquire customers.
Are you the best team to go after opportunity.
## 2.6 The Tournament Approach
To mitigate uncertainty: diverse across opportunities.

# Module 3: Markets, Need-Finding and Planning
3w:
Who buys
What product they buy today
Why do they will buy product tomorrow

Profitability, growth.

## Understanding user needs.
Gather raw data (survey, focus groups, interviews 5-20 subjects)
For interview: focus on user needs, no leading questions, ask about current behaviour rather than future, ask for specific answers. Interview content: user behaviour patterns (demographic data), identify steps in customer journey.
Interpret the data
Prioritise

##3.3 Competitive Analysis
Judo strategy.
Why industry will fail to react aggressively upon you (windows of time, below radar
Emphasise skill over strength & avoid overt head to head competition

Complimentary assets:
Resources (relationships, brand name)
You can do (capabilities):
Strategies:
Value chain (improving existing experience)
Disruptive
Blue ocean (create new market space)

## 3.4 Generating Ideas with Individuals and Groups
Hybrid approach is people work alone then share & discuss results.

## 3.5 Planning: Assumptions
Customer value (need, competition, pricing, partners)
Technology & operations (planing, operations, staffing & hiring, technology, building the long term).
Sales & marketing (channels, customer acquisitions, optimisation)
Financial and profit(projections, investment)

Rate assumptions.
Cost: money, time, effort.

## 3.6 Planning: Discovery Driven Planning
Discovery driven planning:
Start with a goal (numeric outcome).
Map the operation steps for your enterprise (start from customer.
Build a reverse income statement (start from numeric goal).
Benchmark your assumptions.
Match milestones to assumptions.

No more than 30 replanning.

# Week 4.
## THE ELEVATOR PITCH
The Problem (“Pain Point”) 
Your Solution 
Target Market 
Competition 
The Team 
Financial Summary 
Milestones 

Authenticity & passion matters. Pitch is a way to start conversation.
## TESTING YOUR IDEA: SURVEYS
Survey. Size 100 -> 10%
Audience
friends - might be not presented
Purchased samples (mechanical turk 0.75$ per survey)
Targeted ads
Notes on question:
Consider demographic questions at top
Only use Yes/No to qualify 
Avoid with open-ended questions 
Exact answers, scales with common sense, monadic price (give price in question, random number in question), conjoint analysis
Pretest.
Looking for:
Variance
Comfort and understand questions
Annoyance & bias
Timing
Analyse results:
Results rates
Under 20% a problem
Use comparison to overall population

## CREATING A PROTOTYPE – PHYSICAL GOODS
Focused on one feature
Comprehensive
Prove solution works, prove dogs eat dog food

## CREATING A PROTOTYPE – SOFTWARE
Throwaway prototyping
Evolutionary prototyping

Static vs interactive.
AXURE, Balsamiq and omnigraffle.

## CREATING A PROTOTYPE - SERVICES
