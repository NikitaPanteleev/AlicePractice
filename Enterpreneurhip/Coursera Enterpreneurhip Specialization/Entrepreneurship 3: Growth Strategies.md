# Week 1 Module 1: Acquiring Customers and Forecasting Demand
Customer acquisition economics 
– Customer value over time (base profile up to premium)
– Customer lifetime value and return on investment 
– Customer equity

Customer acquisition principles and examples 
– Acquisition targeting approach 
– Example: Making a splash, treatment and selection 
– Research: Acquisition methods and geography

Customer Lifetime Value (Concept) 
• Acquisition costs (The following are adjusted for periodicity) 
• Retention rate (Estimated as the percentage of customers returning when they have the option to leave) 
• Revenue (The amount spent per period) 
• Costs (Variable marketing costs of retention and servicing )
• Discount rate

CLV = sum of (price - cost) * retention ^ T / (1 + d) ^ T

Be selective initially, Be prepared to see acquisition efforts get harder!, be aware the more you get customer the more you should pay to acquire the next one, investors like fewer transactions

Making a splash

## Two sided market
Examples: Desktop/mobile OS, gaming consoles
Pricing: Subsidize one side and charge the “rent” to the other side
Other Strategies to address liquidity challenges include 
– Obtaining supply from other marketplaces (e.g. AirBnB originally obtained listings from Craigslist) 
– Leverage influencers with a large base of followers 
– Manual matching of supply and demand 
– Use one side to market to the other side (e.g. Etsy sellers bring many buyers to Etsy)
## DIFFUSION AND ADOPTION
Diffusion even of tvs, mobile, air conditions is low.
Innovators - the chasm where most start up die - early adopters - early majority - late majority - laggards.
Explaining Diffusion Rates Rogers’ Five Factors (Intrinsic Attributes of Innovation) 
1. Relative advantage 
2. Visibility 
3. Trialability 
4. Simplicity 
5. Compatibility
Key insights:
 - Time to “take off” much longer than you expect for new category products. 
• Intrinsic attributes of the innovation strongly influence diffusion rates. 
• You can modify some of those attributes (e.g., trialability) through design choices. 
• Be realistic in assessing time to take off. 
• Some innovations will never take o
# FORECASTING DEMAND
Mitigating “devastating risk” 
– Overcoming projection bias (mcdonalds in china has different model
– ACCORD model (Relative Advantage, Built in Compatibility with other goods,Reduced Complexity, High Observability  of benefits,Low Risk of failure, Ease of Divisibility for trial )
– Qualitative research (testing the process) (online forums, groups, web survey chat, online communication, in depth interview).

Key principles and examples 
– Demand decomposition 
– Forecasting rules and methods 
– What if Eisenhower is “wrong”? (Things are more like they are now than they ever were before)

• Setting up 
– Find and consult as many as domain experts as possible
 – Decompose the customer behaviors that lead to demand and identify the levers
 • Judgmental Methods 
– Ask experts to write reasons for and against their forecasts 
– Use structured analogies (remember Eisenhower!) 
– Combine independent forecasts
 • Causal Methods 
– Regression based are the most common
Demand Forecasting Under Uncertainty 
• Total Market Demand 
– Attempt to identify all potential end users and uses (primary demand focus) 
• Identify Components 
– Focus on constituent parts and segments 
• Forecast Drivers 
– Develop a point of view on end use 
• Conduct Sensitivity
 – Identify discontinuities that could cause dramatic change

# Week 2 Marketing and PR

# Week 3.Cost Structures, Pricing, and Tracking
## TARGET COSTING AND CHANNEL ECONOMICS
Quantity * (price - cost) > fixed costs
Key Idea 
• Set price based on market logic. 
• Work backwards from price to set cost target. 
• Check your cost of goods against the cost target.

50% to retailer (wholesale)
Target cost = cost of goods (COGS)
Cross margin = (price - cost)/ price
Mark up = price/cost - 1 = cross marine / (1 - cross margin)

Making depends on 
High volume -> lower price
Higher price -> lower price
Less differential -> lower margin
Fashion - 60% making
Building - 20%
Typical consumer goods 35% - 50%

Factor cost + duties + freight = landed cost
Landed cost + scrap & shrinkage = cost of goods.

#HOW TO PRICE
Ceiling (demand factors, EVC (economic value to customer) and WTP (will to pay).
|
price
|
Floor (cost factors).

WTP - monetary value(functional + psychological) provided by a new product relative to status quo.

Price discrimination
First degreee (unique per customer).
Second degree (quantity discount).
Third degree (by location, by identity, context, date).

=====================================
$95 - ends at 5. 99 tends to cheaper discount value

Principle: Reduce Incentives for Search (buy fast).
Principle: Increase Ease of Comparison (compare your product with others if you are the cheapest)
Principle: Highlight Total Expenditures
Principle: Increase Sunk Costs or Switching Costs
Principle: Reference Pricing (discount is not real)
Principle: Compromise Effect (show high price options to increase the medium option)

# PERFORMANCE MEASURES (KPI).
What are the critical few metrics that determine your success? 
Typically 3 – 5 key metrics. 
These are often called Key Performance Indicators or (KPIs). 
Typically tracked and reported monthly (or more frequently)
Sku = stock keeping unit.
 
year Goals with traffic light metaphore.

# Sales partnerships
Terapass (buy card to mitigate fuel damage) reaches new customers with Expedia, ford and chocolates

## MAKE / BUY DECISIONS
What are the entrepreneurial benefits of “buying” from others? 
Avoid duplicative investments
Division of labor according to comparative advantage
Pay for results rather than paying for effort

# Creating and scaling company culture.
## ATTRACTING, DEVELOPING, AND RETAINING TALENT
How to hire
Artist (based on impression) 25% effectiveness
Sponge ( a lot of data) 20%
Prosecutore (agressive testing, pressure) 10%
Spy (live with candidate) 100%
Formal checklist - 80%

Avoid homophile (hire people like you). Assign pre-work.
Interview:
As many people as possible (3-5 is fine)
Definitely ask historical questions:
Potentially ask behavioral/hypothetical questions:
Make the experience as great & fair as possible
Close hard

Maintaining performance (constant & formal).
Termination:
Frequent
Formal
Forward-looking
Filed (written, with signatures)

## BUILDING THE RIGHT CULTURE FOR GROWTH
Basis:
Compensation (“money”) 
Qualities of the task (“work”) 
Community at work (“love”)
Criteria for selection
Skills 
Exceptional talent, or potential 
Fit with the team
Means of coordination and control
Direct monitoring
Peer or cultural control
Professional standards
Formal processes and procedures
Star model:
Attachment to work, Selection is stars, Control is professional
Commitment Model
Attachment to people and culture, Selection is for cultural fit, Control is cultural/peer
Engineering Model
Attachment to challenging work, Selection is competence for the current tasks, Control is peer
Bureaucracy Model
Attachment to work, Selection is competence for the current task, Control is formal procedures
Autocracy Model
Attachment to compensation, Selection is competence for the current tasks, Control is direct monitoring

Engineering is a good default choice, commitment is the fastest, star is good for innovation.
Consistent model is better than switching.
