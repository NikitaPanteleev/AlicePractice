4 approaches
1) facilitative - minimal framework
2) formulative - formal descriptions 
3) directive - take directions
4) manipulative - leader, reward and threaten

3 formats
1) separate only "shuttle diplomacy" - impossible meeting, short issue, doesn't rebuild relationship.
2) joint only - fix relationships, transparency, loss of information shared.
3) mixed

traps
