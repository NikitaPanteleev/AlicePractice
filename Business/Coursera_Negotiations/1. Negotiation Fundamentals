Why negotiation fail, respect your mandate, create value.
## The usual bargaining tactics
Darks side: 
1. Extreme anchoring. Unrealistic number is thrown at the table. Counter: ask for justification.
2. Making the other negotiate against himself (ask to prepare better offer). Counter: be ready to discuss now.
3. Adding non-related issues.Counter: focus on original topics. Counter 2: gaining some time.
4. The red herring. One side pretend that something is important to them and then later “painfully” give this item away. Counter: be curious and dig deeper.
5. The good / bad cop.Counter: don’t be impressed.
6. “My hands are tired”. Involve his boss to test this strategy.
7. The ultimatum. Compare with SAFT. Respond with counter-ultimatum.
