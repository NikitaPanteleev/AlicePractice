Essential Scala: Six Core Principles for Learning Scala
1. Expressions, types, & values
2. Objects and classes
3. Algebraic data types
4. Structural recursion
5. Sequencing computation (fold, map, flatMap)
6. Type classes http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5408861/what-are-type-classes-in-scala-useful-for

4. - ADT. Model your data in terms of OR(sum type) and AND(product type). User is logged OR
   anononmyous. Logged user has id AND email

product type A has B AND C: `final case class A(b: B, c: C)`
sum type A has B or C: `sealed trait A; final case class B() extends
A; final case class C() extends A;`

Use structural recursion on ADT: pattern matching (match cases in
trait A) or (define abstract method in A; implement in each case
class)

5. fold : A => B is used with ADT. (futures, infinite streams are not ADT)

BNF-like notation vs Combinator
left-recursion is nonterminal. there are ways to overcome it.
Backtracking schemas are problematic. Local backtracking (PEG).
Deterministic parser is formula-1 car;
General parser is a jeep.
Order precedence. Lexing and Parsing.
 - Disambiguation filters
 - General parser
 - Combinator parser

Type signature is a Theorem and function definition is the proof
*Types*
 - reduce bugs
 - make code run faster
 - define interfaces
 - Check compilation
 - document model

*Model*
The main feature is to throw this model away.

Easy way and lazy street.
Types = For All
Tests = There exists

sbt-native-packager -> sbt stage

1. Codebase.
 1. version for every package
 2. git submodule
2. Dependencies in local file - vendoring. 
3. Configure. Litmus test (can you opensource code without
   compromising any credentials).
 1. Configuration should be stored in the environment. And you can
    extract information in `conf/application.conf` from ENV.
4. Build, release and run.
5. Process.
 1. Processes should be stateless
6. Port binding.

 - Enforce style guidelines
 - Enforce compiler warnings
 - Make failing tests critical
 - Use testing frameworks
 - Have real time statistics
 - Profile regularly

Raise the bus factor (one teammember is hitten by the bus).
Multiple hats.
