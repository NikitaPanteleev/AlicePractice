# Foundations
## Type Theory

A homotopy between a pair of continuous maps f : X → Y and g : X → Y is a continuous map H : X × [0, 1] → Y satisfying H(x, 0) = f (x) and H(x, 1) = g(x). The homotopy H may be thought of as a “continuous deformation” of f into g. The spaces X and Y are said to be homotopy equivalent, X ≃ Y, if there are continuous maps going back and forth, the composites of which are homotopical to the respective identity mappings, i.e., if they are isomorphic “up to homotopy”. Homotopy equivalent spaces have the same algebraic invariants (e.g., homology, or the fundamental group), and are said to have the same homotopy type.
