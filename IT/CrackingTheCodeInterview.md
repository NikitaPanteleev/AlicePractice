# Chapter 4. Before the interview
CV
- In the US, it is strongly advised to keep a resume to one page if you have less than ten years of experience.

Work on projects.

# Chapter 5. Behavioral Questions
Describe your experience as:
- Situation
- Action
- Result


# The Big O
### Intro
Time complexity, Space complexity. Big O shows only runtime growth.

### Big O, Big omega, big theta
Big O - upper bound;
Big omega - lower bound;
bit theta means algorithm both Big O and Big omega


### AmortizedTime
ArrayList. Increase memory when reach N elements.
So it increases 1 + 2 + 4+ 8 ... + X = 2X. X insertion takes 2X time, so average is O(1) 


logN run times - binary search
recursive calls - 2^n
fibanacci calls 1.6^n
permutations n! * (read carefully code)

# Tech interview
- try to solve on your own
- write code on paper
- test code on paper
- type your paper as-is to computer


### Data structures
- linked lists
- trees, tries & graphs
- stacks & queue
- heaps
- vectors/arraylist
- hash tables

### algorithms
- breadth-first search
- deep-first search 
- binary search
- merge sort
- quick sort

### concepts
- bit manipulation
- memory (stack vs heap)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Big OTime & Space

### preparation
- listen carefully
- draw sufficient example
- state a brute force
- optimiziation

#### BUD optimization
B - bottleneck
U - unneccesary work
D - duplicated work

#### Do it yourself
#### Simplify and Generalize
#### Base Case and Build
#### Data Structure Brainstorm
#### BestConceivableRuntime
